name: Python CI

# This workflow demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline with 2 stages:
# 1. TEST: Run automated tests to verify code quality
# 2. DEPLOY: Publish documentation to GitHub Pages

# WHEN DOES THIS RUN?
# - On every push to the main branch
# - On every pull request targeting main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]  # Trigger on pushes to main
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]  # Trigger on PRs to main

# PERMISSIONS: What can this workflow do?
# These permissions are needed for GitHub Pages deployment
permissions:
  contents: read      # Read the repository files
  pages: write        # Deploy to GitHub Pages
  id-token: write     # Use GitHub's identity token for secure deployment

# JOBS: The actual work to be done
# Jobs run in parallel by default, but we use 'needs:' to make them sequential
jobs:
  # ===== STAGE 1: TEST =====
  # This job runs our Python tests to make sure the code works
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use Ubuntu Linux (free for public repos)
    name: Test
    
    steps:  # A job contains multiple steps
    # Step 1: Get the code from the repository
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Pre-built action to download our code
    
    # Step 2: Install Python on the virtual machine
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4  # Pre-built action to install Python
      with:
        python-version: '3.12'  # Specify which Python version to use
    
    # Step 3: Install our project's dependencies
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |  # Run shell commands
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip  # Update pip first
        pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install our dependencies
    
    # Step 4: Run the tests
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest test_calculator.py  # Execute our test suite

  # ===== STAGE 2: DEPLOY =====
  # This job publishes our documentation website to GitHub Pages
  # IMPORTANT: Only runs if test job succeeds!
  deploy-docs:
    needs: test  # Wait for test job to complete
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
    # CONDITIONAL: Only run on pushes to main branch (not on pull requests)
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
    
    # ENVIRONMENT: Tells GitHub this deploys to the 'github-pages' environment
    # The URL will be automatically set to where the site is deployed
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}  # References the deployment step below
    
    steps:
    # Get the code (needed for docs generation)
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    # Install Python (needed to run our doc generator)
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.12'
    
    # Install dependencies (needed for test results)
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Run our custom script to generate documentation with test results
    - name: Generate documentation with test results
      run: python generate_docs.py  # This updates our HTML with fresh test data
    
    # Configure GitHub Pages deployment
    - name: Setup Pages
      uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
    
    # Upload our docs folder to be deployed
    - name: Upload Pages artifact
      uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
      with:
        path: docs/  # Deploy everything in the docs/ folder
    
    # Actually deploy to GitHub Pages (makes the site live!)
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      id: deployment  # ID needed to reference outputs in environment.url above
      uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
